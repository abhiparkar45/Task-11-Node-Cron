Many applications need to run some sort of scheduled tasks for chores like system maintenance, administration, taking a daily backup of data or sending emails.
A Cron is a time-based job scheduler, which enables applications to schedule a job to run automatically at a certain date or time.
syntax : cron.schedule("second(optional) minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week",callback_function,{ schedule, timezone }(optional));
in a syntax above: second argument and options are optional. by default, if we did not specify second arguments its value becomes 0 and in options object,
by default schedule is true and timezone is server time
